Run the program with the following command:
    python3 HW4-aa5456.py
    
The following packages should be installed: 
    numpy - to calculate dot product and square root for the cosine similarity score
    nltk - to use PorterStemmer to group related stems

The following packages should be installed to run the program: 
    numpy - to calculate dot product and square root for the cosine similarity score
    nltk - to use PorterStemmer to group related stems

Calculate the MAP score with the following command:
    python3 cranfield_score.py cranqrel output.txt

cranfield_score.py is a scorer program
cranqrel is the answer key
output.txt is generated by the program

A more detailed description of the formula to calculate cosine similarity score is given in the lecture 4 slides for CSCI-UA 480 NLP

Outcome: 
Average MAP is: 0.3365762191946312
